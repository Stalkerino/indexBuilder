# Index Builder for TypeScript

The idea is to code and don't bother about the creation of a TypeScript DTS File with node Watcher.
You can let it watch any changements (Work in progress) or generate a DTS from all your files (minor tweaks need to be made)

## Launch
Use `npm start` and chose 1 or 2

##Configuration
Right now, you have to edit all the files to do what you want, in the future, you'll be able to charge a config json file and select profiles and save some.
